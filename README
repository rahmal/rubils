= Rubils

Ruby Utils.  A small collection of common core extentions, utilities, and helper classes for Ruby development.  All the useful code I've found myself using either out of necessity or convienence in most of my ruby projects.

== Requirements

* Ruby (Developed on 1.8.7)

== Install

  sudo gem install rubils

== ToDo

1. Finish JSpecs for existing code (Yeah, I know. Youâ€™re supposed to right the JSpecs first.)
2. Create GemSpec and Rakefile.
3. Prep for release.

== Known Issues

* None
